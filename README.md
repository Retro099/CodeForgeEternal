**Dedicated repository for systematically building Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning skills**  
Targeted toward mid-level AI/ML engineering roles in Japan (April 2026 interviews and beyond).

## 🎯 Goals
- Master end-to-end ML workflows (data → model → evaluation → insights)
- Build a strong, recruiter-friendly portfolio with reproducible projects
- Track consistent progress with weekly routines and milestones
- Integrate Japanese technical vocabulary (JLPT N3/N2 level) for interviews
- Balance coding practice with JLPT preparation
