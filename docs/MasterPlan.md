# CodeForge Eternal – Master Plan 🔥

**Vision:** Secure a mid-level AI/ML engineering role in Japan by April 2026 or sooner.  
Build strong, practical skills in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning while maintaining JLPT N3 → N2 progress.

## Core Principles
- Consistency over intensity (daily/weekly habits)
- Deliberate practice with projects and portfolio focus
- Balance: 60-70% coding/ML, 30-40% Japanese study
- Track everything – no guesswork

## Skill Roadmap (High-Level Milestones)
| Phase | Focus | Timeline | Key Outcomes |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1     | Python Mastery & DS Foundations | Dec 2025 – Jan 2026 | Clean code, Pandas/Numpy fluency, SQL basics |
| 2     | Classical ML End-to-End | Feb – Mar 2026 | Pipelines, evaluation, deployment basics (Streamlit) |
| 3     | Deep Learning Basics | Apr – Jun 2026 | CNNs, RNNs, Transformers with PyTorch/TensorFlow |
| 4     | Advanced & Portfolio Polish | Jul 2026+ | Production ML, MLOps intro, Japanese tech interviews |

## Weekly Routine (Flexible Template)
- **Mon-Wed-Fri:** Coding/ML focus (3-4 hours)
  - 1-2 hours: Structured learning (course/book)
  - 1-2 hours: Hands-on project or notebook
- **Tue-Thu-Sat:** JLPT/Japanese (2-3 hours)
  - Vocabulary + grammar (Anki + Genki/Tobira)
  - Technical Japanese terms (AI/ML vocab list)
- **Sunday:** Review + Planning (1-2 hours)
  - Update progress_log.md
  - Plan next week
  - Mock interview questions (Japanese + technical)

Total: ~20-25 hours/week – sustainable long-term.

## Project Roadmap
1. Customer Churn Prediction → Migrate & polish (done/in progress)
2. Image Classification (CNN basics)
3. NLP Sentiment/Time-Series project
4. End-to-end deployment (Streamlit/Hugging Face)
5. Capstone portfolio project (Japan-related dataset if possible)

Each project → Dedicated folder in `/projects/` with README, notebook, src/, results/.

## Progress Tracking
Use this template weekly in `docs/progress_log.md`:

**Week Ending: [Date]**
- Coding hours: __
- JLPT study hours: __
- Completed: 
  - [ ] Topic/Project milestone
- Japanese vocab added: __ new terms
- Notes/Blockers:

## Resources
- **Python/DS:** Python for Data Analysis (Wes McKinney), Kaggle courses
- **ML:** Hands-On Machine Learning (Aurélien Géron), Scikit-learn docs
- **DL:** Fast.ai, Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera)
- **Japanese:** Genki I/II, Tobira, Anki decks, JLPT official practice
- **Tech Japanese:** "AI/ML terms in Japanese" list (to be added)

## Final Note
This plan evolves – update as needed. Consistency compounds.
